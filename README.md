## What it does

You sit at a mahjong table. A small window shows up, watches your hand, and suggests the best tile to discard and why. Three modes, one click each:

- **Off** — plugin sleeps.
- **Hints** — shows the best discard + top alternatives with a reason. You click every move. *100% safe.*
- **Auto-play** — plays for you with natural pacing that looks like a person thinking.

## Install

In-game: `/xlsettings` → **Experimental** → paste into **Custom Plugin Repositories**:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XeldarAlz/FFXIV-DomanMahjongSolver/main/repo/repo.json
```

Tick the checkbox, save. Then `/xlplugins` → search **Doman Mahjong Solver** → Install. Open with `/mjauto` and accept the short notice.

## Using it

`/mjauto` opens the main window. At a live table it fills in scores for all four seats, your current hand, the top 3 discard candidates with short reasoning, and the last action the plugin took. Under **Settings**: delay slider (how long it "thinks" before each click) and a developer-tools toggle.

**If the plugin misclicks a call prompt** (rare, but complex multi-chi menus can confuse it):

- Click the right option yourself in-game — the plugin resumes on the next turn.
- Or from chat: `/mjauto pass <N>` where `<N>` is the button index (0 = leftmost, rightmost is always Pass).

## Safety — read this

Auto-play uses third-party input automation, which is **against the FFXIV Terms of Service**. Square Enix can and does sanction accounts for it. This plugin is provided as-is. Use **Hints mode** unless you've thought carefully about the risk.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Off by default** | Nothing runs until you accept the notice and pick a non-Off mode. |
| **Hints are safe** | No clicks ever sent to the game in hint mode. Read-only. |
| **Natural pacing** | Auto clicks spaced randomly around 1.2s. Adjustable in settings. |
| **Kill switch** | Flip back to Off — every click stops on the next frame, mid-game. |

## Problems?

- **"Plugin failed to load"** — `/xlsettings` → Experimental → Dev Plugin Locations: remove any stale entry pointing at a local folder, then reinstall.
- **No icon in plugin list** — Dalamud caches the repo. Refresh the custom-repo entry in Experimental, or restart the game.
- **Anything else** — [open an issue](https://github.com/XeldarAlz/FFXIV-DomanMahjongSolver/issues) with the error text.

## License

**AGPL-3.0-or-later.** Source is open; derivatives must be too.

### Build & test

```bash
dotnet build DomanMahjongAI.sln
dotnet test  DomanMahjongAI.sln
```

**196 tests** across:

- **Engine** (140 tests) — tiles, shanten, ukeire, yaku, fu, scoring, call-candidate derivation.
- **Policy** (56 tests) — efficiency policy, riichi / call / push-fold evaluators, Bayesian opponent model, ISMCTS with progressive widening, hand simulator, evolutionary weight tuner, Tenhou log parser.

Engine and Policy are Dalamud-free and portable.

```

### Releasing

Bump `<Version>` in `DomanMahjongAI/DomanMahjongAI.csproj` **and** `AssemblyVersion` + `TestingAssemblyVersion` in `repo/repo.json` (all must match). Merge to main → `auto-tag` workflow creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag → `release` workflow builds and uploads `latest.zip`. On first run per version, the release tag sometimes needs a one-time manual re-push (GitHub won't let workflow-pushed tags trigger other workflows).

### Known outstanding work

- Self-initiated riichi / tsumo / ron / ankan use speculative `FireCallback` opcodes — accepts at call prompts work (opcode 11, option 0); discard-time declarations may still fail.
- Opponent discard pools, dora indicator, dealer, round wind, honba are unread — the opponent model runs on a partial view.
- Multi-chi variant selection currently always picks the first variant (leftmost button).
- Tracked open melds are lost on mid-round plugin reload (scorer falls back to tsumogiri until hand stabilizes).
